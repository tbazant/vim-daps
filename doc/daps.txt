*daps.txt* Plugin for using daps (https://opensuse.github.io/daps) commands inside Vim.

                                                           *daps-installation*
I recommend using a plugin manager such as vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
to install and update vim-daps.
If you do not want to use a plugin manager, download and uncompress the tarball into
your ~/.vim/plugin directory.

                                                           *daps-requirements*
You need to have daps (https://opensuse.github.io/daps) installed to use vim-daps
