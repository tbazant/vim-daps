*daps.txt* Plugin for using daps (https://opensuse.github.io/daps) commands inside Vim.

                                                           *daps-installation*
I recommend using a plugin manager such as vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
to install and update vim-daps.
If you do not want to use a plugin manager, download and uncompress the tarball into
your ~/.vim/plugin directory.

                                                           *daps-requirements*
You need to have daps (https://opensuse.github.io/daps) installed to use vim-daps
commands in your Vim editor.


Note:
Before using any of vim-daps commands, you first have to specify which DC file
you are going to use in the current buffer with the :DapsSetDCfile <DC-file> command.

Commands:
:DapsSetDCfile <dc-file>
  Specifies the DC file to be used by the current Vim buffer.

:DapsValidate
  Validates the DocBook XML document specified by the give DC file.

:DapsHtml
  Builds HTML from the DocBook XML document in the current buffer.

:DapsPdf
  Builds PDF from the DocBook XML document in the current buffer.

:DapsXmlFormat
  Beautifies the XML source code in the current buffer.

                                                           *daps-settings*
This plugin _will_ have settings in the future.
