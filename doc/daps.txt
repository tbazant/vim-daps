*daps.txt* Plugin for using daps (https://opensuse.github.io/daps) commands inside Vim.

                                                           *daps-installation*
I recommend using a plugin manager such as vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
to install and update vim-daps.
If you do not want to use a plugin manager, download and uncompress the tarball into
your ~/.vim/plugin directory.

                                                           *daps-requirements*
You need to have daps (https://opensuse.github.io/daps) installed to use vim-daps
commands in your Vim editor.


Note:
Before using any of vim-daps commands, you first have to specify which DC file
you are going to use in the current buffer with the :DapsSetDCfile <DC-file> command.
You can make vim-daps ask you for the DC file on a new buffer startup by setting
g:let daps_dcfile_autostart = 1

Commands:
:DapsSetDCfile <dc-file>
  Specifies the DC file to be used by the current Vim buffer.

:DapsSetSpellLang <lang>
  Spiecifies language for the aspell dictionary, 'en_US' by default.

:DapsValidate
  Validates the DocBook XML document specified by the give DC file.

:DapsHtml
  Builds HTML from the DocBook XML document in the current buffer.
  If the cursor is on a suitable line with id="...', then this
  ROOTID will be built.

:DapsPdf
  Builds PDF from the DocBook XML document in the current buffer.
  If the cursor is on a suitable line with id="...', then this
  ROOTID will be built.

:DapsXmlFormat
  Beautifies the XML source code in the current buffer.

:DapsImportEntites <entity_file>
  Imports XML entities found in the given file for auto-completion
  purposes. If no file is specified, entities are imported from
  the current file's <!ENTITY tag.

:DapsSetDoctype <doctype>
  Set DocType for DocBook documents and import available entities. vim-daps
   ships with 'docbook45', 'docbook50' (default), and 'geekodoc5'.


                                                           *daps-settings*
g:daps_spell_dict_lang = <lang>
  Sets the default language for spell dictionary. Default is 'en_US'.
  You can override it with :DapsSetSpellLang <lang>

g:daps_dcfile_autostart = 1 or 0
  Specifies if Vim should ask you for the DC file for the current
  buffer automatically after new buffer is opened. Note that if DC
  is already provided and you open a new tab, the DC you already provided
  will be used without asking for a new one. You can override the DC file name
  with :DapsSetDCfile for the current buffer.

g:daps_dcfile_glob_pattern = <pattern>
  Set the globbing pattern to be used for DC file autocompletion.

g:daps_entity_import_autostart
  If set to 1, runs XML entity import on DocBook files automatically.

g:daps_entfile_glob_pattern = <pattern>
